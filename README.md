## 📌 About This Repository

Hi there!
This repository documents my daily Machine Learning learning journey, combining theory, coding exercises, and projects.
I follow a step-by-step, day-by-day learning approach, sharing my progress and insights.

Everyone is welcome to follow along, learn together, and provide feedback.

* 🚀 Each folder corresponds to a day or a project in the learning journey.
* 🔍 **Each folder contains:**
* ✅ A summary of the concepts learned that day
* ✅ Any code files or notebooks
* ✅ Notes, observations, and key takeaways
* 🏠 The main README gives an overview of the journey and how to explore it.

### 📖 Learning Goals
* Understand Machine Learning theory step by step
* Practice coding ML models in Python using libraries like scikit-learn
* Learn how to evaluate and interpret models
* Build portfolio-ready projects for interviews
* Develop consistency and structured thinking in ML

### 🏷️ Topics & Projects
* Activation Functions, Weights & Biases
* Forward Pass, Predictions, Gradient Descent
* Loss Functions (MSE, Cross-Entropy)
* Train-Test Split, Model Evaluation (Accuracy)
* Projects like Customer Purchase Behavior Prediction
* The number of days will grow as the learning journey continues.

### 📂 How to Explore
* Open any Day folder to see the learning summary and code
* Open notebooks or scripts to run the code yourself
* Read notes and explanations to understand key concepts

### 🚀 How to Use This Repository
* Students & learners: follow along daily to reinforce ML concepts
* Self-practice: clone the repo and run notebooks on your local machine
* Portfolio showcase: recruiters can see your daily learning progress and projects

### ✍️ Notes
* Each day’s folder is short, digestible, and focused on one topic or project
* Focus is on understanding concepts, not just coding
* Each project includes model interpretation and real-world insights

### 🌱 Future Plans
* Continue adding new days as learning progresses
* Add more projects with explanations
* Include DSA & OOP practice alongside ML
* Build interview-ready projects
